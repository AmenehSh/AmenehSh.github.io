<h3> Abstract: </h3>

<p>Individuals with chronic stress can improve their overall wellness by

making lifestyle changes. We describe the design and evaluation of a computer-
animated conversational agent that is used in conjunction with Integrative

Medical Group Visits (IMGV) to help individuals with chronic pain and

depression manage their stress. The agent coaches patients in between group

visit sessions, reviewing how to manage stress using non-pharmaceutical

techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, yoga self-massage). We conducted a

longitudinal clinical trial with 154 participants in which patients in the

intervention group interacted with the conversational agent at home on a touch

screen tablet to reinforce what they learned in group medical visits. Results

from the trial indicate that the conversational agent, in conjunction with medical

group visits, leads to significantly more positive stress management behaviors

being used by patients after 9 and 21 weeks, compared to patients in usual care.</p>

<h3> Statement from Prof. Timothy Bickmore (Adviser) </h3>
<p>The paper reports the design of a 21-week intervention our lab developed
in collaboration with the Complementary and Alternative Medicine
group at Boston Medical Center, along with partial results from
a clinical trial conducted there over two years, for patients with
chronic pain and depression. Ameneh was the project lead at Northeastern,
responsible for collaborating with clinicians at BMC on the design of
the intervention, doing the majority of the implementation, supporting
BMC through focus group studies and pilot testing, and finally the
clinical trial. Ameneh conducted most of the outcome data analyses
reported in the paper, wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and led the
editing process through to the final submission. </p>
